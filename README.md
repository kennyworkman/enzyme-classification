# CNN for Enzyme Classification

3D Convolutional Neural Network that classifies enzymes into one of six groups based on catalytic activity. Volumetric arrays of protein structure, using a variety of intuitive features (atom type, atom function vis a vis enzyme behavior), were used as labeled inputs.
